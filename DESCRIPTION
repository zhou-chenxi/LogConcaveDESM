Description: LogConcaveDESM is an \code{R} package to compute and
                visualize the log-concave score matching density estimate over a bounded domain.
                It also contains functions to plot the first and second derivatives of the log-density estimate.
                Furthermore, functions to compute various distances between two probability distributions
                are provided to assess the quality of the density estimate.
